title: How about snow?
description: "Not all people like snow, but do you? Should there be snow or not? Al think different."

For my own opinion, I do not like snow so much, precisely because it gets so cold.

Then it gets so dark and gloomy, it's much nicer when it's summer, but then it should not be too hot either.
Some people like snow precisely because there are some special activities you can perform at these times.
